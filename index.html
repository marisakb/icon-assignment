For decades, the fashion industry has struggled with diversity when it comes to everything from designers, stylists, and even models. Although a lot of progress has been made, the fashion industry still struggles with representation of dark skin models, plus-sized models, models with disabilities, and Black hairstylists. Today, those in the fashion industry are doing everything in their power to properly represent marginalized communities. Often times, Black models are asked to shave their heads because the back-of-house lacks Black hairstylists. In addition, many shows lack inclusivity when they underrepresent functionality in clothing for people who are plus-sized or disabled. Not only are models and back-of-house employees impacted by diversity issues, but writers, designers, producers, and freelancers too.

In 2021, CFDA x PVH and McKinsey and Company released the State of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Fashion Study and Report. Here, the statistics display the disproportionate gaps among marginalized groups versus white employees. It shows that despite making a lot of progress in the fashion industry in the last 20 years, there are still so many flaws behind the scenes. Throughout these findings, the reports display the impact on communities of color during COVID-19 and how workspaces can become more equitable.

  <br>

  37% of Black employees reported they have to supplement their income, while only 23% of white employees reported the same. This means they have to work another job or find other sources of income, while more white employees are financially secure with one job.</div>

  <div><img class="two" src="fashion.png" width="150" height="150"><br>

  <br>

  48% of respondents reported receiving a job referral. 57% of white employees benefitted from the referals, while only 23% of Black employees were referred. This shows the prejudice prior to interviews before POC even enter the workspace.</div>

  <div><img class="three" src="diversity.png" width="150" height="150"><br>

  <br>	

  Respondents of color (26% POC, 40% Black, 27% Asian) reported a negative impact on receiving raises and/or promotions versus the 1% white who reported a negative outcome. This proves that most higher-up positions lack diversity.</div>

  <br>	

  51% of LGBTQIA+ reported greater inaccessibility to the fashion industry. In addition, 67% of Black and 65% of LGBTQIA+ employees reported the highest rates of experiencing microagressions in the workspace. </div>

  <br>

  67% of women in the U.S. are above a size 14 in clothes. However, only 2% of women represented in the media are plus-size (editorial) This shows the underrepresentation of normal bodies versus society's standards of a non-common body type.</div>
